**Credit Card Fraud Detection**
# Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraudulent transactions making up a very small percentage of the total. The system aims to minimize false positives while accurately identifying fraud.

# Features

Handles imbalanced dataset using resampling techniques (SMOTE/undersampling).

Trained using machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

Data preprocessing: scaling, feature selection, and handling missing values.

Evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost

# How It Works

Load and explore the dataset.

Preprocess data (normalize, handle imbalance, split into train/test).

Train models on the dataset.

Evaluate models using multiple metrics.

Predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

Usage
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CreditCard-Fraud-Detection.git

# Navigate to project folder
cd CreditCard-Fraud-Detection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the detection script
python fraud_detection.py

Results

Achieved high ROC-AUC and recall on fraudulent transactions.

Reduced false positives using tuned thresholds.

Future Enhancements

Implement real-time fraud detection pipeline.

Add deep learning models (LSTM, Autoencoders).

Deploy as a web API for integration with banking systems.
